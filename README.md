# DistancingViolationDetectionSystem
 Worked on the computer vision based social distancing violation detection system for COVID-19.
• Used YOLO for pedestrian detection.
• Used holography transformation for image to real-world mapping.
• Implemented simple online and Realtime tracking with a deep association metric for algorithm optimization. It is
based on Kalman filter, Hungarian algorithm, and Multiple Object Tracking.
• Reduce the number of identity switches by 45%
